        <p class="context">Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All
            right, $16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960.
            Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru. </p>
        <p>Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. If I give up
            Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, 'Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from
            giving me up?' Y'see, so, then where's the trust? </p>
        <p>Walter, I'm your lawyer. Anything you say to me is totally privileged. I'm not in the shakedown racket. I'm a
            lawyer. Even drug dealers need lawyers, right? Especially drug dealers. </p>
