        Don't you get it? <span> the outside it's a nail salon right</span>, on the inside it's the best money laundering a growing boy
        could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You know you need to
        launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering, integration. Well, you wanna
        stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got three little letters for ya, I -
        R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.

        Hey look, here's you right - pink... Pinkman, get it? Here's your cash. You're out on the town, yeah you're partying
        hardy, you're knocking boots with the chicky babes and aww! Who's this? It's the tax man and he's looking at you.
        And what does he see? He sees a young fella, big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job. Now what is the
        conclusion the tax man makes? Aaaaannnt! Wrong! Millions times worse - you're a tax cheat. What do they do? They
        take every penny and you go in the can for felony tax evasion. Ouch! What was your mistake? You didn't launder your
        money! Now, you give me your money, okay that's called placement.

        Hand me that little thing, bin. This is the nail salon, right. I take your dirty money and I slip it into the
        salon's nice clean cash flow - that's called layering. Final step - integration. The revenues from the salon go to
        the owner - that's you! Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean taxable income brought to you by
        a savvy investment in a thriving business. Yeah and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become say a convict, then
        maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.

        Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 laundered at
        75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your
        family a second hand Subaru.
        Two words: nail, salon. It's perfect for money laundering, it's a high-volume, cash-preferred business with a
        discreet workforce. Nobody does mista-me-know-nothing better than Mrs. Mukjayaporn and her gals.
